# Contributing

So, you want to contribute? Great!  
Contributing is not only about creating fixes, but also reporting bugs. Before reporting a bug, please make sure to use the latest version of the project! 


Issues
======

--Fill In--


Mandatory things when creating a ticket:  
========================================

- Branch  
- Commit Hash

- Clear title and description of the bug - if your english is very bad, please use google translate or yandex to translate to english and include one text in your native language.

When reporting a crash, you MUST compile in debug mode because release dumps are useless.

We sugest the title and body to have the next style:


Creating Pull Requests:
=======================

1. Fork it.
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b fixes`) (Note: fixes is an arbitrary name, choose whatever you want here)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am "Added Snarkdown"`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin fixes`)
5. Open a Pull Request


When creating patches read:
- *Create Standards File*
- [Git Squash](https://ariejan.net/2011/07/05/git-squash-your-latests-commits-into-one/)


We suggest that you create one branch for each C++ based fix: this will allow you to create more fixes without having to wait for your pull request to be merged.
